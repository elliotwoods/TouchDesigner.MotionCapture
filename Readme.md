# Introduction

A library of motion capture operators for Touch Designer.

These operators triangulate bright features in corresponding camera images (e.g. retroreflective markers).

# Installation

You will need some extra files which aren't inside this repo. Specifically DLL's for OpenCV with CUDA and CUDA itself. These are available at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yjeef9fvf588hhf/AADe-vf76ImbWikNl6mRIAhwa?dl=0 .

In the future we may remove the requirement for CUDA if it becomes a problem.
